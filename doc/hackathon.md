# ENS hackathon

The registration of the hackathon (NOT the workshop) is now open via BlockPary (Dapp that prevents no-shows with staking).

http://enshack.noblockno.party

Please note that we have limited capacity and advise to RSVP before it runs out of the spot.

We prepare a small FAQ to set your expectations. If there are any other questions, feel free to email to makoto@ens.domains

## FAQ

### How do I RSVP?

You pay small deposit (0.02ETH) when you RSVP. You lose your deposit if you do not turn up. You will be able to withdraw your deposit back + we split the deposit of whom did not turn up.

Please access the URL above via Dapp enabled wallet (Metamask/Status.im/Toshi/CiphyerBrowser/TrustWallet,etc) pointing to Mainnet.

Please bring QR code with your public key so that it's easy for us to check you in. Mobile wallets are great ways to carry your ETH address (unless you already have ENS) and here is how you use it.

The dapp automatically sets gasprice from https://ethgasstation.info to the cheapest possible but that may cause your transaction to take a long time to get confirmed when the network is congested. The gas price is getting volatile recently so you may want to check https://gitcoin.co/gas/history or https://twitter.com/EtherFees to find out when the gas price is cheap to RSVP.

If you struggle to use the Dapp, please feel free to contact makoto@ens.domains

### Can I share this URL so that my friends can also register?

Yes, but please also make sure your friends also fill in the form so that we can email any updates.

### What about the workshop I also applied for?

Space at the workshop is very limited, and unfortunately we werenâ€™t able to accommodate everyone who applied. Look out for a separate workshop invitation (via EventBrite) if your application has been accepted.

We will try to set up video streaming so that you can tune-in the conversation remotely.

### What can we hack?

It's up to you as long as it is related to ENS. You can integrate ENS reverse lookup into your Dapp or join some of the initiatives which may come up as the end of the Friday workshop. Feel free to suggest your ideas at our discussion forum to exchange idea.

### Where should we book my accommodation?

The event takes place at King's College London campus and the closest tube stations are Temple (District/Circle line), Holborn (Central/Picadilly line) or Embankment (Bakerloo/Northern/District/Circle).

The area of the venue is relatively pricey so you may choose to stay in the area where the above tube lines pass. East/South London is relatively cheaper than North/Central/West London in general.

### What is the schedule of the event?

We are in the middle of finalizing the schedule and we will email you a few weeks before the hackathon.

### How many people are participating?

We have a capacity of around 70~80 participants at the venue. The majority of the Friday workshop participants will be also  joining in addition to the hackathon participants.

### Can we join remotely.

This registration is for on-site participation only.
We have received a few inquiries for remote participation so we will let you know if we later decide to include remote participation.
